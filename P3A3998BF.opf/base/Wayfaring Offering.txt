↑ The editors of the 2012 edition of Jamyang Khyentse's collected writings have labelled this
originally untitled text as a lam bsang, which translates (roughly) as "Wayfaring Offering
of Incense Smoke", but the text itself makes no mention of smoke offering and refers only
to a serkyem, or golden drink. The English title has thus been kept deliberately vague.
